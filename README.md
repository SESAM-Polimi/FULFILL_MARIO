## Overview

This repository provides all code, data, and instructions required to reproduce the scenarios and results presented in the paper. The analysis is based on the [MARIO](https://github.com/it-is-me-mario/MARIO) software package, which is used for environmentally extended input-output modeling.

All data and results are also available on Zenodo:

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Install all dependencies using the provided Conda environment file:

```bash
conda env create -f _environment.yml
conda activate fulfill_env

```

### 2. Data Download

All required data can be downloaded automatically by running the notebooks in sequence.

Alternatively, you can manually download the full dataset from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15070606) and extract the contents into the appropriate folders (`Data/`, `Shocks/`, etc.) as described in each notebook.


## Workflow 
### Step 1: Database Preparation

Run `1. Database building.ipynb` to:

- Download and extract the Exiobase v3.3.18 database in MARIO format.  
- Parse and aggregate the database using MARIO.  
- Add new supply chains and performs other minor manipulations to the database where needed.  
- Save the processed database for scenario analysis.
- This step runs in 5-10 minutes on a MacBook Pro M3 Pro 18 GB RAM


### Step 2: Build Shock Files

Run `2. Shock building.ipynb` to:

- Download and extract all supporting files for shock construction.  
- Build scenario-specific shock files for all combinations of background, measure, and year.  
- Save the resulting files in `Shocks/filled_files/`.
- This step runs in around 10 minutes on a MacBook Pro M3 Pro 18 GB RAM

### Step 3: Run Model Scenarios

Run `3. Model run.ipynb` to:

- Parse the prepared MARIO-formatted database.  
- Loop through each scenario, run shock calculations, and export results.  
- Aggregate and merge outputs for analysis.
- This step runs in approximately 8 hours on a MacBook Pro M3 Pro 18 GB RAM. 

### Outputs

All scenario results are saved in:

- `Outputs/Results/`: Scenario outputs, organized by matrix and scenario.  
- `Outputs/Results/Merged/`: Merged results for each matrix, ready for analysis.
